My final thesis report: 
"DDACVaR: Distributional Deterministic Actor Critic approach for CVaR optimization in Reinforcement Learning".
A model-free RL algorithm that is able to learn risk-averse policies in an off-policy and a fully offline setting.

Continuation of my work led to the publication 'Risk-averse Offline Reinforcement Learning' in the Offline Reinforcement Learning Workshop at NeurIPS2020.
Paper can be found here: https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/program/offrl_35.html and a short video explaining it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBF0Pcj-qI&feature=youtu.be
Code would be availabe soon.
