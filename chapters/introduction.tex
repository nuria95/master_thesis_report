Decision-making is the process of taking choices by identifying an optimal strategy
from current system states. 
A crucial element in the process is the performance measure used
to assess how good the choice is for the decision-maker or agent.

In sequential decision-making problems, the most common optimization criterion is the 
expectation of the cumulative reward collected by the agent, which leads to a \textit{risk-neutral}
behavior.

However, this approach neither takes in to account the variability of the rewards (i.e fluctuations around the mean),
nor its sensitivity to modeling errors. 
In some scenarios affected by measurement or modelling errors, such as autonomous navigation,
finances or medicine, and in which the safety of the agent is particularly important, it is crucial to ensure that
only \textit{safe} action strategies will take place,
for example, ensuring received rewards will always remain above a critical threshold.

In many works, the concept of safety or its opposite risk is related to the inherent stochasticity of the environment
and with the fact, that under those environments, even an optimal policy with respect to the cumulative reward,
may perform poorly in some cases. Since maximizing the expected cumulative-reward does not necessarily imply 
the avoidance of rare occurrences of large negative outcomes, we need other criteria to evaluate risk. \citep{Garcia2015}

Risk-sensitive decision-making provides a promising
approach to compute robust and safe policies, but
finding computationally tractable and conceptually meaningful methodologies for such a goal is non-trivial
and still a challenge.

In this thesis, we focus on the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, a branch of machine learning
that focuses on dynamic decision making in unknown environments, and propose a risk-sensitive approach
to act \textit{safely} in a non-deterministic environment.
