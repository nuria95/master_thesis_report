\section{Summary:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter 1. Introduction: Interest in doing risk-averse, CVaR, state of the art
    \item Chapter 2. RL.Explain RL goal, explain risk-averse RL (cvar) goal. Important in decision theory not only base on expected utility.
         Mostly literature on-policy algorithms.
    \item Chapter 3.(Old chapter 4 + 2) Explain OUR algorithm. 
            DPG (beta and mu, where beta is an exploration policy and for dpg is mu + noise)
            Offline
            To learn tail: Distributional RL
    \item Chapter 4. Chow on-policy AC algorithm and comparison with ours. Disadvantages
    \item Batch RL
    \item Results: Car, cheetah, maybe walker/hopper?
    \item Discussion: Maybe no need to learn the whole distribution but just tail on critic
\end{enumerate}
